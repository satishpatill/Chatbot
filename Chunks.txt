Poor Network Security Measures
Bad or no security practices at all can pose a great threat to your business and its database of sensitive files. This is why keeping your network secure is a critical consideration for any organization’s IT sector, regardless of size.
Moreover, smaller businesses are at a greater risk of having their network breached because they often do not have robust security policies in place, making them ideal targets for malicious actors.
To ensure your network and technology devices are safe and secure, proactively seek solutions such as:
•  Multi-factor authentication
•  Firewalls and other forms of connectivity security
•  Data back-ups
•  Training employees in security principles
•  Keeping passwords particularly secure

Outdated Equipment
Businesses using outdated, obsolete equipment are also at risk of experiencing severe technical difficulties. Small businesses with budget restraints are particularly affected, while other companies suffer from the complexity of integrating new hardware into their IT infrastructure.
While the fact that old tech equipment may malfunction is evident, the true danger lies in the inability to receive new software updates, making it prone to cyberattacks.
It is important to maintain your equipment regularly and stave off the inevitable decline for as long as possible. It’s also vital to use support services, replace parts of the IT infrastructure, and, whenever possible, factor in new equipment within the limits of your budget.
Consulting with IT experts is especially needed in this case, as their advice can limit your expenditure and help you work within your budget. They can also help with freezing, crashing, and the general slow performance of your hardware, but more on that in a bit.

Data Loss and Lack of Recovery Plan
Losing 100 important files can incur financial losses of up to $35,000 for any business, with large-scale damages being in the millions.
Organizations can lose their data due to many reasons, such as:
•  Cyberattacks
•  Equipment malfunction
•  Human error
•  Power outage
•  Catastrophic events
To soften the blow these threats present to your business, you need to have a detailed disaster recovery plan in place that would consist of cloud-based data backup, IT support contacts, backup servers, and external storage.
Cloud services use multiple security measures that let you store and access your sensitive information from anywhere in the world.

Loss of Passwords
Another inevitable occurrence in the workplace is that people will forget their passwords. It is also one of the most frequently recurring issues with IT troubleshooting services.
This is a highly disruptive event that can damage your team’s productivity and affect the final output levels. To avoid this, your organization should use software that allows you to generate thousands of very strong passwords and secure them in an online, cloud-based vault.
Tools like Zoho Vault, Dashlane, LastPass, and NordPass have multiple recovery options, making them quite cost-effective solutions, as most of their pricing tiers are very reasonable.
"""


"""
Slow Performance
As we mentioned with outdated equipment, computers, servers, and other components that perform slowly can hinder your company’s productivity and affect employees’ job satisfaction. The slow performance is often caused by outdated or simply poorly chosen hardware, depending on your needs.
While upgrading the hardware is the only foolproof solution, there are certain measures you can take before that is feasible.
Inefficient Use of RAM
In case end-point systems have insufficient random-access memory (RAM), instruct your staff to keep open only those applications that they use. For example, if they have too many tabs open in their browsers or a lot of apps running in the background, this can significantly slow down the device if it doesn’t have enough RAM.
Keeping only what you need open reduces the usage of RAM.
Lack of Hard Drive Space
Another common cause of slow-performing systems is the lack of sufficient space on the computers’ hard drives.
If there is too much data on employees’ drives where the operating system (OS) is installed, the entire system may slow down.
Malicious Files and Viruses
Systems that are infected with malware are usually slowed down, apparently for no reason at all. If you’ve determined that the system’s specifications are adequate, but it’s still slowing down, you might want to check for malware.
Antivirus, antimalware, and anti-spyware software are essential nowadays, so make sure your entire IT infrastructure is equipped with appropriate cybersecurity solutions.
"""


"""
Unrestricted Access to Data and Other Information
Your organization’s employees need access to certain data and files so that they can perform their tasks efficiently and successfully. However, not all of them need access to all the files and data in your IT system.
While this isn’t necessarily an IT issue at face value, all employees having access to sensitive data presents an additional attack vector that malicious actors may exploit.
When giving your employees access to certain data systems, make sure each of them gets access only to those systems they need for specific job duties, i.e., practice the principle of least privilege.
"""


"""
Accidentally Deleted Files
One of the most common IT problems, but also one that is very easy to avoid, is losing files to accidental deletions.
As soon as the file is deleted — and in case whoever deletes them notices that right away — you should inspect the recycle bin to see if the file is there. Restoring it is quite easy in this case. Also, if you know the file’s name, try searching for it in case it got accidentally moved instead of deleted.
To prevent any accidental permanent file deletions, it is advisable to use programs that sync all your system files to cloud drive systems, such as Google Drive, OneDrive or your provider’s cloud storage.
This effectively creates a copy of your file and saves it to the cloud so that even if in the unfortunate event that you do delete the file permanently, the most recent version can be downloaded from the cloud.
However, even that doesn’t guarantee that your files are completely safe from being lost, as cyberattacks also target cloud-stored data. Now that syncing files to the cloud is not enough, it is also advisable to have a backup IT cloud solution that would fully eliminate the risk of permanent file loss.
Finally, if you are certain that your file is lost and you don’t use cloud storage, look for specialized IT support partners that can help you recover lost files. Top-quality IT providers will automatically back up all your data, making sure that any files you lost can be recovered quickly and efficiently
"""

Insufficient IT Support
To cap things off, one final overarching issue can simply be insufficient IT support. As you’ve seen, there are plenty of potential setbacks your business can experience, and without a dedicated IT team, solving some of them may prove very challenging.
When you're faced with IT complications, you need experienced professionals who can not only address the problems quickly but also provide preventative solutions to minimize future disruptions. When this level of support is absent, the resulting downtime can impact your business considerably.
What’s more, the stress stemming from unresolved IT problems can deteriorate both the morale and efficiency of your employees.

Overheating
When your computer generates more heat than it’s able to handle then it’ll overheat.
This can be serious because your device may either shut down without warning or even suffer permanent damage.
To avoid this, follow these simple steps:
Keep it clean
Dust accumulation is a big culprit and it can dramatically reduce the lifespan of your computer.
Having vast amounts of dust build-up near your fan will raise the temperature of your device, further increasing the chances of overheating.
Make sure to give your device a regular clean to stop this from happening.
Before attempting to clean your system, we would always suggest that you contact your IT Support team as the problem may lie elsewhere and dismantling parts of your system will only increase the risk of damage.
Give your computer some breathing space
Any object or material that’s blocking the fan will inhibit its ability to cool the machine.
Avoid placing the computer near anything that radiates heat e.g a radiator.
Be wary of the sun
This is particularly relevant to laptops.
If you’re going to work outside when it’s sunny, make sure to avoid direct sunlight and sit in the shade.
Needless to say, this will almost certainly decrease the chances of your device overheating.

Low search ranking
Search engine optimization (SEO) allows search engines to correctly identify your content, resulting in a higher search engine results page (SERP) ranking, increased web traffic, and higher-quality leads. 
Poor SEO, however, can lower your SERP ranking, making it difficult for users to find your website. For example, one study found that: 
1.  The #1 position on Google SERPs gets 34% of all website traffic
2.  Improving your page's SERP ranking from #2 to #1 will double website traffic
3.  The #1 search result receives the same amount of user traffic as #2, #3, #4, and #5 combined
In other words: users aren't just going to come out of nowhere. SEO is crucial in attracting users to your website by ensuring it's visible in the top position on the SERP. 
How to troubleshoot SEO website issues:
•  Maximize keywords: use tools like Semrush's keyword generator to optimize your text in content headers, meta tags, and URLs to improve search engine rankings and make it easy for new users to understand what your website’s about
•  Ensure your website is indexed: check if your website has been indexed with a URL Inspection tool, as some new websites can take up to six months to appear on SERPs
•  Increase content publication: regularly publishing high-quality, authoritative content helps you attract new users, expand organic website traffic, build brand trust, and increase referrals

Security breaches
A breach in your website's security can cause several problems, including a PR nightmare that could irreversibly damage your users' trust in your brand. And don't assume that hackers only go after bigger businesses; in fact, the opposite is often true, as smaller businesses tend to de-prioritize website security. 
An unsafe website puts users at risk of having personal information stolen—their names, addresses, and credit card numbers could be used for identity theft and financial fraud. Security vulnerabilities could also allow hackers to infect user devices with malware or spam, causing device damage and compromising privacy.
How to prevent security breaches: 
•  Monitor your website's security: utilize services like Cloudflare, SiteLock, or Sucuri to continuously scan your website for issues, identify threats, and quickly resolve breaches
•  Keep your codebase up to date: regularly update all plug-ins, APIs, and scripts to the latest versions to prevent unauthorized access
•  Implement HTTPS protocol: use HTTPS (not HTTP) to ensure that any data transferred between your site and users is encrypted. This is especially important if your website requests personal information from visitors, like shipping addresses, credit card numbers, or phone numbers.
•  Get an SSL certificate: an SSL certificate validates your website's identity, enables a protected, encrypted connection to keep all user transactions safe, and improves website location on the SERP

Broken pages and redirects
There is little more frustrating (and confusing) for a user than clicking on a link or button that sends them to a 404 error page. 
In addition to increasing the probability of a user abandoning your website, Google and other search engine algorithms also penalize websites with too many broken pages, dysfunctional links, and redirects. This lowers your website's SERP ranking, resulting in fewer visitors.
How to troubleshoot broken pages and redirects:
•  Crawl your website: use website monitoring tools to identify broken pages and website bugs, before too many users stumble upon them
•  Continuously check for broken links: use tools like Dead Link Checker or Google Search Console to periodically check your website for dysfunctional links
•  Optimize your 404 error pages: instead of the generic ‘page not found’ text, offer users problem-solving information, such as links to FAQs, similar content pages, or a website search bar
•  Insert 301 redirects: if you move or delete a page, set up a 301 redirect link to a relevant, working page on your website. This ensures users avoid 404 error pages and still land on a page relevant to their original query.

•  Conduct user research: identify user pain points, needs, and motivations by conducting user research through customer interviews or focus groups
•  Use high-quality images: avoid pixelated images using tools like Canva, PhotoShop, or Kranken.io to adjust and compress images, without losing quality
•  Streamline site navigation: guide visitors through your site and connect them to the most relevant pages by including easy-to-use navigation bars, search functions, and calls to action (CTAs) on every page
•  Apply consistent style: choose consistent design styles, like color schemes, fonts, and button sizes, to reduce user distraction and curate an aesthetically pleasing experience

Security breaches
A breach in your website's security can cause several problems, including a PR nightmare that could irreversibly damage your users' trust in your brand. And don't assume that hackers only go after bigger businesses; in fact, the opposite is often true, as smaller businesses tend to de-prioritize website security. 
An unsafe website puts users at risk of having personal information stolen—their names, addresses, and credit card numbers could be used for identity theft and financial fraud. Security vulnerabilities could also allow hackers to infect user devices with malware or spam, causing device damage and compromising privacy.
How to prevent security breaches: 
•  Monitor your website's security: utilize services like Cloudflare, SiteLock, or Sucuri to continuously scan your website for issues, identify threats, and quickly resolve breaches
•  Keep your codebase up to date: regularly update all plug-ins, APIs, and scripts to the latest versions to prevent unauthorized access
•  Implement HTTPS protocol: use HTTPS (not HTTP) to ensure that any data transferred between your site and users is encrypted. This is especially important if your website requests personal information from visitors, like shipping addresses, credit card numbers, or phone numbers.
•  Get an SSL certificate: an SSL certificate validates your website's identity, enables a protected, encrypted connection to keep all user transactions safe, and improves website location on the SERP

Broken pages and redirects
There is little more frustrating (and confusing) for a user than clicking on a link or button that sends them to a 404 error page. 
In addition to increasing the probability of a user abandoning your website, Google and other search engine algorithms also penalize websites with too many broken pages, dysfunctional links, and redirects. This lowers your website's SERP ranking, resulting in fewer visitors.
How to troubleshoot broken pages and redirects:
•  Crawl your website: use website monitoring tools to identify broken pages and website bugs, before too many users stumble upon them
•  Continuously check for broken links: use tools like Dead Link Checker or Google Search Console to periodically check your website for dysfunctional links
•  Optimize your 404 error pages: instead of the generic ‘page not found’ text, offer users problem-solving information, such as links to FAQs, similar content pages, or a website search bar
•  Insert 301 redirects: if you move or delete a page, set up a 301 redirect link to a relevant, working page on your website. This ensures users avoid 404 error pages and still land on a page relevant to their original query.

Slow loading time
An estimated 40% of consumers leave a website if it doesn't load within three seconds. Losing visitors as a result of slow loading time also increases your website's bounce rate—which, similar to broken pages and redirects, hurts your search engine rankings. 
Slow loading time can also make your website appear unprofessional to users, leading to decreased brand credibility.
How to improve website loading time:
•  Test your load time: use PageSpeed Insights and GTmetrix to monitor your website's performance speed
•  Reduce image size: use tools like TinyImage, Compressor.io, or Optimole to compress the images on your site, without losing quality
•  Use a caching plug-in: plug-ins like W3 Total Cache and WP Super Cache store a static version of your website, making it load faster for recurring users
•  Use external files: compress critical CSS, HTML, and Javascript documents by setting up CSS and JavaScript in external files
•  Use system fonts: avoid custom web fonts, which take up significant space on your website. Instead choose system fonts like Arial, Verdana, and Helvetica.

Clunky sign-up processes
Even a couple of extra steps in a registration form can quickly turn users away from your site. In fact, studies find that more than 85% of users feel bothered when they have to create a new account on a website. Those who do may go on to sign up forget their login credentials or fail to validate their email address. Adding social sign-up options on your website eliminates this issue. 
How to optimize the sign-up process: 
•  Watch recordings: review user recordings first to confirm users are struggling with the sign-up process—and then to pinpoint the specific step causing difficulty
•  Use a social media plug-in: add your website host's social media login plug-in for popular social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, or Google
•  Use customer identity solution integrations: use social APIs like LoginRadius, OneLogin, and OneAll Social Login to integrate your website log-in with over 30 social networks and customize the user log-in journey.

Lack of contact information
Clearly detailing contact information on your website legitimizes your business and builds brand trust by providing a transparent way for users to contact you with questions or feedback. 
While larger monolith businesses like Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft are notoriously bad at providing a direct route to human contact, small- and medium-sized businesses may lose important leads by not making it clear how to get in touch.
How to make contact information more accessible:
•  Set up a contact page: create an easy-to-find page on your website that includes a contact form, your business phone number, and an email address
•  Integrate a live chat: increase user convenience by offering answers to their questions in real-time with software tools like Intercom, Hubspot, and LiveChat, without them needing to wait on the phone or send an email
•  Include social media links: link your social media accounts to your website to further legitimize your business and offer additional routes for users to connect with you
